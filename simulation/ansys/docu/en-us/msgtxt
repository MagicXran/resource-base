the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try incrementing the load more 
slowly (increase the number of substeps or decrease the time step size).  You 
may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  
Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint 
equations.  Please rule out other root causes of this failure before attempting 
rezoning or nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first 
iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.
