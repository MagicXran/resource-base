Quick Installation Guide
========================

This guide helps you to get a working TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg| installation. It is only a short guideline,
please refer to the **Thermo-Calc Installation Guides** for more details if required.

The present documentation is also included in your installation as a PDF-file. In the Thermo-Calc menu, select
**Help → Manuals Folder**. Then double-click to open the **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** folder.

.. note::

    A license is required to run TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg|.

.. note::

    TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg| is available for Windows.


Installing TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg|
---------------------------------------

Automatic Installation of TC-Toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the following conditions are met, Thermo-Calc automatically installs the TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg| component
on your computer.

1. MATLAB\ |reg| is already installed.
2. There is only one Windows user on the computer where TC-Toolbox is being installed.

    .. note::
        Administrator privileges are needed when you start the Thermo-Calc installer.

Then follow the regular installation instructions for Thermo-Calc, choosing whether you use a Standalone or Network
installation.


Manual Installation of TC-Toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installation is not automatic if:

    * There are multiple Windows users on the same machine, or
    * The installer cannot find the directory path to the MATLAB\ |reg| installation.


Multiple Windows Users on Same Machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If there are multiple Windows users on the same machine, then the following manual steps are done at the end of
the automatic installation.

1. A message at the end of the Thermo-Calc installation process displays with instructions.
2. An Explorer window automatically opens to this folder :file:`C:\\Users\\<user>\\Documents\\Thermo-Calc\\2023b\\SDK\\TC-Toolbox-MATLAB`.
3. Double-click the :file:`InstallTCToolboxMATLAB.cmd` file to finalize the process. This briefly launches
   MATLAB\ |reg| and installs TC-Toolbox.


Installer Cannot Find the MATLAB\ |reg| Installation Directory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Start the version of MATLAB\ |reg| that you want to install TC-Toolbox in.
2. Open and run the script :file:`C:\\Users\\<user>\\Documents\\Thermo-Calc\\2023b\\SDK\\TC-Toolbox-MATLAB\\setupTCToolbox.m`.


For more information, se the more detailed
instructions given in the **Thermo-Calc Installation Guides**.


Check the Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check if the installation was successful start MATLAB\ |reg| and run, for example, the diagnostics script, which
is located in the folder
:file:`C:\\Users\\<user>\\Documents\\Thermo-Calc\\2023b\\SDK\\TC-Toolbox-MATLAB\\Examples\\Miscellaneous`.

Alternatively open the **Add-Ons** menu (in the **HOME** tab) in MATLAB\ |reg| and choose **Manage Add-Ons**. If
the toolbox is installed it will be included in this list.

Uninstalling TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg|
-----------------------------------------

If you are logged in as a **user with administrator rights, and have Thermo-Calc installed for this user**, then the
uninstallation is automatically done at the same time as a full Thermo-Calc uninstallation. Otherwise a manual step
is required:

.. note::
    To uninstall the TC-Toolbox for MATLAB\ |reg| if it is not uninstalled by the Thermo-Calc uninstaller, start
    MATLAB\ |reg| and select (in the **HOME** tab) **Manage Add-Ons** from the **Add-Ons** menu. Right-click
    TC-Toolbox and choose **Uninstall**.
