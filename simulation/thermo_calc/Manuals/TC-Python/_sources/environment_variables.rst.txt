Mac OS: Setting Environment Variables
=====================================

    In order to use TC-Python on Mac you need to set some environment variables.

    .. code-block:: bash

        TC23B_HOME=/Applications/Thermo-Calc-2023b.app/Contents/Resources

    If you use a license server:

    .. code-block:: bash

        LSHOST=<name-of-the-license-server>

    If you have a node-locked license:

    .. code-block:: bash

        LSHOST=NO-NET
        LSERVRC=/Users/Shared/Thermo-Calc/lservrc


    In PyCharm, you can add environment variables in the configurations.

    Select **Runâ†’Edit Configurations** to open the **Run/Debug Configurations** window. Choose **Templates** and then
    **Python**. Enter the environment variable(s) by clicking the button to the right of the **Environment Variables**
    text field. Now the environment variables(s) will be set for each new configuration by default.

    .. note::

        Existing configurations need to be removed and recreated to obtain the environment variables in them.

    The same way for configuring the environment variables can be used on other operating systems as if
    necessary.
